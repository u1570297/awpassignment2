						<p>It was a coincidental meeting halfway around the world that sparked the idea for Daniel Wellington. On this trip, our founder Filip Tysander met an intriguing British gentleman with impeccable yet unpretentious style. The man had a particular fondness for wearing his vintage watches on old, weathered NATO straps. His name? Daniel Wellington. Inspired by his new acquaintance’s timeless style, Filip decided to create his own line of watches. Minimalistic and refined, the classic design with interchangeable straps truly has wide-ranging appeal. Now a few years later, this design is still an important part of what makes Daniel Wellington so special.Armani Exchange, born in 1991, targets a generation of fast-fashion consumers through an accessible collection offering urban, individual style. A|X Armani Exchange continues to define a new dress code with a collection that takes its cue from urban lifestyle and young culture. The youthful collection is now available at Prime Time Cambodia, bringing Italian design to young Khmers.</p>
